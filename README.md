# To contribute, go to the Cupboard-Template Folder and download "New Year Workbook Template.xltm" and the "Master Sheet Macros.bas"
# Open the "Master Sheet Macros.bas" with Notepad (or Notepad++, if you have it). Use your Find function (ctrl-f in Windows and Linux),
# search for "SaveAs". This should take you to two lines of code. Update the line that says "UPDATE THIS ONE ->", remove everthing before
# ThisWorkbook (including the ') and change the path to a Test Folder of your choosing. 
# Next, open the "New Year Workbook Template.xltm". If you do not have the Office 365 suite, you can download it through your school mail.
# A blank Excel sheet will load. If you do not have the Developer tab at the top, right-click on the ribbon and select "Customize the ribbon".
# On the right, select Developer and click ok. Navigate to the Developer Tab, find "View Code" and click it. In the VBA Editor, on the left side,
# go to Modules and right click on Module1 and remove it. Do not export it. go to File -> "Import File". Find the "Master Sheet Macros.bas" and 
# import it.
# Now you can return to the excel sheet. Left-click on Macros and run the "NewWorkbookONLY" function. Fill in whatever dates you see fit. You now 
# have a working test workbook. We'll try to get a workbook with dummy data rolled out as soon as possible. 
#
# Let me know if you have any further questions.
